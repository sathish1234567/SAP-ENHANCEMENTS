Question:
We create a Sales Order (eg. ZXXX) through a Z-development. My requirement is that this particular document type should not be created using t.code VA01. 
Need a validation for VA01 in the first screen itself 
( where the document type, Sales Org, Dist Channel and Divn is entered) to restrict creation of document type ZXXX thru t.code VA01


Answer:
I've implemented a couple of times this using the following technique.

Program MV45AFZZ -> FORM userexit_field_modification -> include zv45afzz02

When you go to VA01 and insert the document type and press enter, the system will stop in this userexit.

Here you just have to do a statement like this.

IF SY-TCODE = 'VA01' AND VBAK-AUART ='XXXX' <- the document type you want to block.

MESSAGE EXXX(XXX) WITH VBAK-AUART. <- Create a new error message (SE91) ''Sales document XXXX cannot be created via this transaction.''

ENDIF.

Please let me know if this helped you,

Regards,
